            <h1>To all those this may concern:</h1>
            <h2>Recently there has been a spat of arguments among us. There was a time not so long ago when we were all friends, and we had peaceful, friendly conversations. But as of late, we’ve been fighting. Originally they were a couple of isolated incidents, however these soon grew into repetitive disputes. Now they’ve become near every day occurrences. And in all truth and honesty, I’m sick of it – And I’m sure many of you are too. My personal concern is that our friendships are in jeopardy.</h2>
	<h2>Whether or not the involved parties believe in the same thing, whether or not they have different political views, whether or not they are old or young, there should be peace among them. We should set our differences aside. Now, that’s not to say that if someone attacks you, you can’t defend yourself. If they choose to be rude, or tormenting, that’s their problem. The repercussions are their problems. What I am requesting is that we are simply all friendly again. No more arguing, no more shameless insulting, no more threatening.</h2>
<h2>I came to the internet, specifically Twitter, to meet people with similar interests to mine. I appreciate all of you immensely. But please, let’s stop being so unpleasant around each other. Let’s stop the hate.</h2>
            <h1>We are all human, after all.</h1>
