        <h1>For the longest time,</h1>
        <h2>religion was the easiest way to explain what happened in the universe. We didn’t have the knowledge or the technology to prove otherwise. We went by what we thought was correct, what was logical. Now we have science. Science is what seems to be the most plausible explanation so far. But for all we know, science is completely wrong. Several people have tried to tell me otherwise tonight.</h2>
        <h2>They say science is the right way and the only way to explain things. They imply that religion is unbelievable and ridiculous. And yes, it most certainly seems like it! Science, in my mind and many others’ minds, is the best way to explain the goings on in our world and universe! But how are we to know if it is actually right? Are we going to use science to prove science? We can’t prove anything. We cannot prove that we exist. For all we know – and this is going to sound vacuous, but nonetheless – we could just be imaginary. For all we know, we don’t “exist”. We don’t know what existence is, we don’t know our purpose on this planet. And this is why religion is such a complicated, sensitive subject. There are some people who – to put this bluntly – are stuck in the past. They are running Windows ME, they are writing with quills, they are using candles for light – metaphorically of course. Science is the most modern, logical, plausible way to believe.</h2>
        <h2>Did you notice how I used the word “believe”? “Believe” is defined as “accepting something as true”. And science is what many of us are accepting as true. Others are accepting their own faiths as true. We all believe in something, we all accept something to be true, in one way or another.</h2>
        <h1>And there’s nothing wrong with that.</h1>
